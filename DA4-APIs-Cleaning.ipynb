    "The dataset we are going to use is going to be downloaded by your code!! We are going to download weather data from the [MeteoStat API](https://dev.meteostat.net/). This weather data may be very useful for your project 😎\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Before you start working with any new API, you want to read the documentation. Take some time and poke around [MeteoStat's JSON API](https://dev.meteostat.net/api/#json-api). Specifically, look at:\n",
    "1. How to get an API key\n",
    "    1. Follow the instructions on the MeteoStat documentation which sends you to [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/meteostat/api/meteostat/)\n",
    "    1. Sign up for a RapidAPI account (note: DO NOT enter a credit card, we will use the free tier)\n",
    "    1. Then go to https://rapidapi.com/meteostat/api/meteostat/ and click on the blue Open playground link in the left sidebar\n",
    "        1. Note: you may need to click a blue button towards the middle of the page that says: \"subscribe to test\"\n",
    "        1. You will find your API key as the value of the `X-RapidAPI-Key` key\n",
    "        1. Note: unlike MapBox API, this API key goes in the \"headers\" of a GET request. For example: \n",
    "            1. `headers = {\"x-rapidapi-key\": YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}`\n",
    "            1. `requests.get(url=url, headers=headers, params=params)`\n",
    "1. The [daily data endpoint](https://dev.meteostat.net/api/stations/daily.html)\n",
    "    1. This requires a weather station ID\n",
    "1. You can get a weather station ID from the [nearby stations endpoint](https://dev.meteostat.net/api/stations/nearby.html)\n",
    "    1. This requires a latitude and longitude\n",
    "    1. You can get latitude and longitude from an address (e.g. a city name, like \"spokane\") using forward geocoding\n",
    "    1. MapBox provides a [Geocoding API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/) to do forward geocoding 🤓\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "Write Python code in a main.py and a utils.py based on the MapBox and MeteoStat API documentation to do the following:\n",
    "1. Prompt the user for the name of a large city\n",
    "    1. If there are spaces in the name, replace them with +\n",
    "1. Using the user-entered city, make a request to MapBox to get the city's latitude and longitude\n",
    "    1. Use the API key we made in class for MapBox\n",
    "    1. Extract the city's latitude and longitude. Store these in variables.\n",
    "1. Using the latitude and longitude variables, make a request to MeteoStat to get the coordinates' station ID\n",
    "    1. Extract the city's weather station ID. Store this in a variable.\n",
    "1. Using your weather station ID variable, get daily weather data for the previous year (2025-02-06 through 2026-02-06)\n",
    "    1. Set the units to be imperial to get Fahrenheit instead of Celsius\n",
    " 2. Structure this data nicely into a pandas' DataFrame\n",
    "    - Note: You do not need to manually read/loop through the json data to create a dataframe, you can merely pass it in as when creating a new dataframe.\n",
    "2. Write the DataFrame to a csv file using the filename convention: `<city name>_daily_weather.csv`\n",
    "3. Clean the DataFrame so there are no missing values\n",
    "    1. Note: you may need to explore different cities to find one with missing data to appropriately test your solution\n",
    "    2. Remove columns with more than 50% of data missing\n",
    "    3. Fill the remaining missing values\n",
    "        1. Values should be filled with linear interpolation (see the [`interpolate()` documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html#pandas.DataFrame.interpolate) documentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write the cleaned DataFrame to a csv file using the filename convention: `<city name>_daily_weather_cleaned.csv`"

The API doesn't need to be fancy or related to your project (but great if it does!). Ultimately I just want you to get more practice with APIs.\n",

    "Read Chapter 1 of [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815) by Cathy O'Neil. This book is a NY Times bestseller, National Book Award longlist winner, and frequently mentioned as one of the top non-technical data science/big data books that everyone should read (here are a few lists: [kdnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/12/non-technical-reading-list-data-science.html), [dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-books/), [builtin](https://builtin.com/data-science/data-science-books), etc.). You don't need to purchase this book, unless you want a hard-copy or you want to read the whole thing. I'll post the sections we will read to Canvas under the appropriate module for the DA so they are not publicly available on Github/GDrive.\n",

Are there some domains that you think models should not be applied to? Or if models are already applied to such domains, do you wish they had not been applied? Explain your reasoning with examples.\n",
    "1. Based on your experience with social media (or the experiences of your friends/family/others), what models do you think are used in social media? Would you consider these models WMDs? Here are some questions from the chapter to help you form your answer: \"...is the model opaque, or even invisible?\", \"Does the model work against the subject's interests?\", \"In short, is it unfair?\", \"Does it damage or destroy lives?\", and \"...can it scale?\" Cite at least one source to support your claims.\n",
